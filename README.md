Tiny BME280 Arduino Library
========================================

Based on the [SparkFun BME280 Arduino Libary](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BME280_Arduino_Library) this library aims to minimize the memory footprint in order to use it with tiny MCUs (like Atmel's ATtiny85/84).

This library allows the user to:

* Read pressure in Pa
* Read temperature in C or F
* Read humidity in %RH
